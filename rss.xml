            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>TonRunner</h1><p>This is my scrapbook of all things that interest, amuse, fascinate and inspire me in the world of swimming, cycling and running.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>10 Moves to Keep You Healthy</h1><p>Any weakness in your kinetic chain can compromise your form, leading to gait changes that increase your risk of getting hurt. Plus, strong muscles absorb more of the force that occurs when you strike the ground, meaning less of it remains to damage your bones, joints, and ligaments.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 Race Schedule</h1><p>I like competing, I never used to but I have found more and more that I do. It maybe that I have come to accept that I am not really competing against anyone else merely against myself; can I go further faster or higher than I have done before. I think it also comes with the realisation that there is always going to be somebody better than you. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e291c9a1e5bb0b8d795676320e6c26daaf39dd4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Although it's great to have a mindset where you enjoy being active, many people would much rather spend time relaxing on their couch than hitting the gym or going for a run.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/700934bff32761b578de9ba74b928e56e9a3b193.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Find Zen Through Running</h1><p>Buddhists have a way to tame those animals: meditation. This ancient practice is traditionally done while sitting and focusing on your breathing to achieve peace of mind. But more and more runners are learning how to clear out the commotion while on roads and trails, thanks in part to Sakyong Jamgon Mipham Rinpoche, spiritual leader of a global network of Shambhala Centers (meditation meeting places).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8a626cfb3a65e5906a9c701fe58789884681cfa3.jpg"></article>]]></description>
