            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why runners should do Pilates</h1><p>Pilates is often compared to yoga, but they actually have very different backgrounds. While yoga is a centuries-old practice with close links to spirituality, Pilates is a mind and body conditioning technique developed by Joseph Pilates in the 1920s. Classes feature exercises to improve core stability and encourage healthy posture.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3101a23ef0771a54274c8aa535ea11196b549b28.jpg"></article>]]></description>

In a damning report that accuses major public health bodies of colluding with the food industry, the National Obesity Forum and the Public Health Collaboration call for a "major overhaul" of current dietary guidelines.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/241177133cd78e2fe3ff8407f647f23b25e9990c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Pre race preperation for Ocean Lake Tri clubs first Aquathlon of the year.</h1><p>A great evening race at Leybourne Lakes. My first ever aquathlon! The race had two distances running simultaneously a 750m swim and a 1500m swim each followed by a 5k run. The two running together was slightly confusing and led to me going off far to fast on the swim. Got to about 25om metre and nearly died, slowed down a bit recovered and the second lap of the swim was much more comfortable with less people.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/abb003394db3241debc4739b39fcd293b35f0786.jpg"></article>]]></description>
