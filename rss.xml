            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is your perfect run mileage?</h1><p>Not all runners are created equal, and neither are their weekly mileage numbers. "Not all athletes who are capable of the same performance have the same work capacity.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ditch The Long, Slow Distance</h1><p>Times, they are a changin', and the traditional marathoner mentality that long, slow distance gets the job done is becoming a thing of the past. If you've completed a few marathons and want to run faster, running long, hard runs could be a key training stimulus for you.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/745bd446481be2591e6d00d20ef15b9cbf2c4d58.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Mobility Monday! Today we look at the almighty Squat! The squat is one of the most (if not the most) important shapes we should be comfortable in. Strength training aside, the squat is one of the best ways to see if our joints can perform normally. Specifically, we should be able to express all of the following: * Full hip flexion (closing of the hip). You can see this if you are able to get your pockets below your knees. A limit in hip flexion can also manifest with knees caving inwards during the squat (motor control and strength aside). * Maintenance of a neutral spine. Can you maintain the natural lumbar curve in your back when deep in your squat? If not there's a good chance your hips are tight! * Heel stays grounded. If the only way you can achieve full depth is by letting your heels leave the ground, we could be looking at some real stiff ankles. Faults in the above points will typically manifest near end-range in the joint, which in the squat, shows up as we get deeper and deeper. So, how deep can you squat with all those points of performance? Challenge: Can you hold a squat for 2 minutes? 5 minutes? Give it a go once a day and see if you can improve this over a one week span! Happy Monday! #MobilityMonday #TheRunExperience #PositionIsPower #Mobility #RunStrong]]></title>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why runners should do Pilates</h1><p>Pilates is often compared to yoga, but they actually have very different backgrounds. While yoga is a centuries-old practice with close links to spirituality, Pilates is a mind and body conditioning technique developed by Joseph Pilates in the 1920s. Classes feature exercises to improve core stability and encourage healthy posture.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3101a23ef0771a54274c8aa535ea11196b549b28.jpg"></article>]]></description>
