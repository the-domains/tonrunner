            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Barefoot running just the sort of mental thing we wanted, say fitness freaks</h1><p>TRENDY barefoot running is the perfect combination of misery, showing off and pain, according to exercise fanatics. Running without footwear supposedly improves performance, although the key benefits to fitness obsessives are proving how hard they are and making people stare at them.</p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thedailymash.co.uk/images/stories/runner425.jpg?resize=425%2C265"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Brighton Half Marathon 2016]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brighton Half Marathon 2016</h1><p>Sunday 28th February, this is the sixth consecutive year that I have run the Brighton Half, indeed this race was my first ever race over 10km. That first race was wet cold, blowing a gale and utterly miserable; it was so bad that at one stage I was going to quit it was only the fact that I was at the furthest part of the course and that I would have had to cover the ground anyway that I carried on. That was 6 years ago and thankfully we haven't had repeat of those weather conditions since. This Sunday was no exception, chilly yes but otherwise almost perfect running conditions. I say chilly as I parked the car the temperature gauge read 3 degrees; tights were a definite but I was still yet to make a decision on the long sleeve top.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/52dd9f3ba960610b164e4d74c22ecfb4b769c06f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Run away! Why it really doesn't matter what trainers you wear</h1><p>I'm not averse to running: I run most days, for fitness and fresh air, and because it's healthier than drugs for enhancing one's mood. It's sociable, too: I've made good friends through my local running club. But certain social aspects of this pastime bore me to the brink of despair, and top of the tree of tedium is trash-talk about shoes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7c2bd9800caab1775c2c0c5bc8e09655f6c4e42e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[11 Weeks to Brighton ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>11 Weeks to Brighton </h1><h2>10 & 9 weeks to Brighton</h2><p>One of the many things I have learned about running and in particular training,  over the last five years is that you can only succeed if you have a goal. If you don't have a goal there is no incentive to train 'hard'. I use the term 'hard' because I actually enjoy running and would more than happily just go for a jog in the countryside, but that is not training. What I mean is having the discipline to go out when the weather is lashing it down, pushing yourself for that last 2miles of a threshold run when it would be so easy to pack it in early, after all who is ever going to know?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a51598d1c3bba9ed5d1f0e973c9029afc8e9bb34.jpg"></article>]]></description>
