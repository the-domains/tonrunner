            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One year since Park Run phenomenon took off</h1><p>EVERY week hundreds of people dressed in T-shirts and trainers head out together, in Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells, united by one thing - a love for the open air and running. This is parkrun - not a stroll in the park - but more a gentle jog or even a sprint.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5b48115e9a1decdb98446b15c2eeca7e448d9768.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Swim to win</h1><p>First, a confession: my interest in swimming began after I read about Michael Phelps' diet. The decorated Olympic swimmer, I found out, consumes a whopping 12,000 calories a day, involving the chomping down of pizzas, pasta and eight-egg omelettes. If Phelpsy can eat all that and look completely ripped, maybe it's time the rest of us headed to the pool, hey?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f2777c0bc9d2b41f651f87535a2dbab5fe2306c3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Best Way To Warm Up</h1><p>Dynamic warm-up drills may be the single best way to prevent injuries and improve performance. As a rule, runners tend to be well-informed when it comes to understanding the best ways to stay healthy and avoid injury.
