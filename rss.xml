            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Swim to win</h1><p>First, a confession: my interest in swimming began after I read about Michael Phelps' diet. The decorated Olympic swimmer, I found out, consumes a whopping 12,000 calories a day, involving the chomping down of pizzas, pasta and eight-egg omelettes. If Phelpsy can eat all that and look completely ripped, maybe it's time the rest of us headed to the pool, hey?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f2777c0bc9d2b41f651f87535a2dbab5fe2306c3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Best Way To Warm Up</h1><p>Dynamic warm-up drills may be the single best way to prevent injuries and improve performance. As a rule, runners tend to be well-informed when it comes to understanding the best ways to stay healthy and avoid injury. Most runners pay close attention to their diet, monitor their weekly mileage, and replace their running shoes at regular intervals.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e0b4837566c1677748dee88e5bfaa6578f749745.jpg"></article>]]></description>
