            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Run away! Why it really doesn't matter what trainers you wear</h1><p>I'm not averse to running: I run most days, for fitness and fresh air, and because it's healthier than drugs for enhancing one's mood. It's sociable, too: I've made good friends through my local running club. But certain social aspects of this pastime bore me to the brink of despair, and top of the tree of tedium is trash-talk about shoes.</p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8c3d31f7e0a038740662b6423a67c82e587bfe0/0_102_2560_1537/2560.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=afaf6dfe6e8440897b2af3634ed0339e"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[11 Weeks to Brighton ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>11 Weeks to Brighton </h1><h2>10 & 9 weeks to Brighton</h2><p>One of the many things I have learned about running and in particular training,  over the last five years is that you can only succeed if you have a goal. If you don't have a goal there is no incentive to train 'hard'. I use the term 'hard' because I actually enjoy running and would more than happily just go for a jog in the countryside, but that is not training. What I mean is having the discipline to go out when the weather is lashing it down, pushing yourself for that last 2miles of a threshold run when it would be so easy to pack it in early, after all who is ever going to know?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a51598d1c3bba9ed5d1f0e973c9029afc8e9bb34.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 Race Schedule</h1><p>I like competing, I never used to but I have found more and more that I do. It maybe that I have come to accept that I am not really competing against anyone else merely against myself; can I go further faster or higher than I have done before. I think it also comes with the realisation that there is always going to be somebody better than you. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e291c9a1e5bb0b8d795676320e6c26daaf39dd4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
