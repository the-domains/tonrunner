            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>After-drop is real - and how to deal with it</h1><p>If you have spent any time hanging around open water swimmers you may have heard the term "after-drop". If you've done any swimming in cool water, you may have experienced it. For the uninitiated, after-drop refers to the decline in your core body temperature after you have got out of the water.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/59f5a092917000b6d9b9acdc7c94107ca6423f9e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brighton Marathon 2016</h1><p>Had a good day at the office, having had a good first 8 weeks to the training my original intention was to go for a 3:05 her and gain good for age for London next year; you may remember my half marathon time suggested I was on the right track, unfortunately since then I have had a back injury that has plagued training and meant that in the last 6 weeks I have done no speed work and my longest run has been just under 12 miles, prior to that I had done one 20 mile run. Needless to say I was not going into the run with too many expectations.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/450329c3-fcca-4bd2-aa74-a64ffe229c24.jpg"></article>]]></description>
