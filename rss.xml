            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One week has passed since I crossed the finish line of my first 100km race with these two hero's. </h1><p>Here we are, looking slightly rough, but happy, stunned and all still smiling at the end of our adventures. Armed with a speaker, some music and boundless enthusiasm and energy, we brought the PARTAY to the final 50km of Race To The Stones. For me these races are ALWAYS about people, meeting with and connecting with different people over that one common ground, and I'm so lucky I got to meet these guys and spend what I thought would be a lonely 50k making some connections and memories to last a lifetime. </p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1d1a41f9f891ffd39784e30e8d34ec66/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=490&cropwidth=640&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.cdninstagram.com%2Ft51.2885-15%2Fs640x640%2Fsh0.08%2Fe35%2F13732166_876869382457623_1413435312_n.jpg%3Fig_cache_key%3DMTMwMTA2MzExOTc3NDI3ODQyNw%253D%253D.2&x=0&y=76"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mobility Monday! Today we look at the almighty Squat! The squat is one of the most (if not the most) important shapes we should be comfortable in. </h1><p>Strength training aside, the squat is one of the best ways to see if our joints can perform normally. Specifically, we should be able to express all of the following: * Full hip flexion (closing of the hip). You can see this if you are able to get your pockets below your knees. A limit in hip flexion can also manifest with knees caving inwards during the squat (motor control and strength aside). * Maintenance of a neutral spine. Can you maintain the natural lumbar curve in your back when deep in your squat? If not there's a good chance your hips are tight! * Heel stays grounded. If the only way you can achieve full depth is by letting your heels leave the ground, we could be looking at some real stiff ankles. Faults in the above points will typically manifest near end-range in the joint, which in the squat, shows up as we get deeper and deeper. So, how deep can you squat with all those points of performance? Challenge: Can you hold a squat for 2 minutes? 5 minutes? Give it a go once a day and see if you can improve this over a one week span! Happy Monday! #MobilityMonday #TheRunExperience #PositionIsPower #Mobility #RunStrong</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7fc643742a7e3bf5fb00517ec771c5ae54a2c9ac.jpg"></article>]]></description>
