            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>TonRunner</h1><p>This is my scrapbook of all things that interest, amuse, fascinate and inspire me in the world of swimming, cycling and running.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brighton Marathon 2016</h1><p>Had a good day at the office, having had a good first 8 weeks to the training my original intention was to go for a 3:05 her and gain good for age for London next year; you may remember my half marathon time suggested I was on the right track, unfortunately since then I have had a back injury that has plagued training and meant that in the last 6 weeks I have done no speed work and my longest run has been just under 12 miles, prior to that I had done one 20 mile run. Needless to say I was not going into the run with too many expectations.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/450329c3-fcca-4bd2-aa74-a64ffe229c24.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[3 Best Exercises for Lower Abs]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3 Best Exercises for Lower Abs</h1><p>The 'number one' best exercise for the lower abs is reverse curl ups. This very same exercise helps recruit the pelvic floor muscles which act as a contractile sling across the base of the abdominal cavity. The pelvic floor muscles are often forcibly weakened by the bearing down effects of excessive sit up exercises. In later life, this can lead to incontinence. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0aa73004ccdce4b92ce6128bb631f2146ba02615.jpg"></article>]]></description>
