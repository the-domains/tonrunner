            <title><![CDATA[11 Weeks to Brighton ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>11 Weeks to Brighton </h1><h2>10 weeks to Brighton      </h2><p>One of the many things I have learned about running and in particular training,  over the last five years is that you can only succeed if you have a goal. If you don't have a goal there is no incentive to train 'hard'. I use the term 'hard' because I actually enjoy running and would more than happily just go for a jog in the countryside, but that is not training. What I mean is having the discipline to go out when the weather is lashing it down, pushing yourself for that last 2miles of a threshold run when it would be so easy to pack it in early, after all who is ever going to know?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a51598d1c3bba9ed5d1f0e973c9029afc8e9bb34.jpg"></article>]]></description>

This is the cardinal rule of training for any activity.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 Race Schedule</h1><p>I like competing, I never used to but I have found more and more that I do. It maybe that I have come to accept that I am not really competing against anyone else merely against myself; can I go further faster or higher than I have done before. I think it also comes with the realisation that there is always going to be somebody better than you. </p></article>]]></description>
