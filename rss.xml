            <title><![CDATA[3 Best Exercises for Lower Abs]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3 Best Exercises for Lower Abs</h1><p>The 'number one' best exercise for the lower abs is reverse curl ups. This very same exercise helps recruit the pelvic floor muscles which act as a contractile sling across the base of the abdominal cavity. The pelvic floor muscles are often forcibly weakened by the bearing down effects of excessive sit up exercises. In later life, this can lead to incontinence. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e921ebf00711c6a031dfcde8ee5c522ebe2c3923.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>IF - Rudyard Kipling</h1><p>If you can keep your head when all about you 
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7a4e577f115a20b1fc7be66a057250d5e9b5ddc2.jpg"></article>]]></description>
