53 --><!-- react-empty: 54 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="55"><p>One of the many things I have learned about running andÂ in particularÂ training, Â over the last five years is that you can only succeed if you have a goal. If you don't have a goal there is no incentive to train 'hard'. I use the term 'hard' because IÂ actuallyÂ enjoy running and would more than happily just go for a jog in the countryside, but that is not training. What I mean is having the discipline to go out when the weather is lashing it down, pushing yourself for that last 2miles of a threshold run when it would be so easy to pack it in early, after all who is ever going to know?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="56"><p>The other thing that I have learnt is that you put something 'out there' in the public domain you become accountable for it, people know what your goal is, they want to know how things are going and can give you a virtual push out the door when the mojo is not bouncing. But more importantly they want to know how you do when you make an attempt at your goal; through experience I know that facing those questions having not given it 100% is an experience far worse than any marathon.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="57"><p>So here I am putting it out there:Â </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="58"><blockquote><p>This spring/summer I am going to attempt to run a sub 3hr marathon.</p></blockquote></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="59"><p>Part of any training schedule should include a diary; the diary should include your training programme, what sessions you are going to do when but also it should include a reflective side so that in future training cycles you can look back and see what worked and what didn't. I have to admit at this stage that whilst I record all my data I have never written a descriptive 'blog' so this is a bit of an experiment; but if you you don't do anything different you can't expect different results. A purely data record of my training can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cl_DvZj82hFzsy6fQGn1vheRfsPbCElqLrpQEggV7OY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="60"><p>This was the first week back from holidays and the first week training proper. I had done quite a few hill runs of around 10km in 28 degree heat which was all good for strength, but not really appropriate for endurance or speed. I did however, re-read <i>'Advanced Marathoning' by Pfitzinger & Douglas </i>who training schedule I had used on my previous attempt at sub 3hrs (although was not as honest with the programme or myself as I should have been). I am once again using their 18 week, up to 55 miles a week training plan.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="61"><p>Officially this is known as a recovery week but still involves 37miles of running. Â <b>Monday - </b>Brr it was cold! minus 2 when I got back from doing a 3.5mile slow jog with Hadlow runners I also had Rusty with me. The rest of the week went to plan, with a total of 34miles.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="62"><p>This was the first week of of the next mesocycle; a 5 week block that focus's on 'Lactate Threshold and Endurance' basically a lot of long runs and a lot of pain! This is the block where we train for mental toughness. The weekend previous I did something to my shoulder which means that it really hurts when running. Never the less the miles still need covering; 54 of them in-fact. I was out on Tuesday evening so had to do a 10 mile threshold run from the office at lunch time. The weather was appalling with wind and rain and the run hurt like hell, I wasn't able to keep pace under marathon pace due to the conditions but pushed myself hard. Thursdays medium long run was relatively easy and I had Friday off from swimming in a hope that my shoulder would appreciated the recovery time. Sunday's Long run was an 18 miler which I did as an interval run. with 5 sets of 1 mile MP & 2 miles 20% slower than MP. It was the first run that I have done this session with a hydration pack, rather that just water I put together a drink of squash with 80g of castor sugar (1 letre). I am not sure if it was the fluids or the slower paced sections, but I felt strong at the end which was a 1st!Â </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="63"><p>So the reason for limited updates has been mostly down to pure frustration. Week ten I had the injury to my shoulder started to get better with continued stretches and Â moving my watch to my right arm. I got my mid week runs done with no major issues except my shoulder, however on the Friday Threshold run I started to feel the beginnings of a cold, my wife had one the week previous so I was kind of expecting it, anyway managed to run on the Saturday but Sunday was really snotty and bunged up. I could have probably run but run the risk of the cold getting worse. As it was in week 9 the cold subsided quite quickly I managed to get out for a short run on the Monday and then a comfortable run on Tuesday with no pain in my shoulder and the cold almost gone. Unfortunately straight after my Tuesday run I went and picked up my daughter from gymnastics. Part of the pick-up involves putting all the equipment away. My back felt a bit sore after that but when I woke the next morning I was in a lot of pain! Needless to say I missed the rest of the runs this week. I did however mange a 2mile swim on the Friday and Sunday with a 3mile 'testing the water' jog on the Sunday.Â </p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_ArticleTitle-db792c48-5142-47af-9cd3-3097a6e7fe66" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-left group-graphical-shape-circle  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="64"><div class="Component p-1 ms-fx-r j-c-center a-i-start " data-reactid="65"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="66"><a href="http://www.racetothestones.com/" class=" " data-reactid="67"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="68"><img class="color-loading" data-width="624" data-height="625" data-ratio="0.9984" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/34bb784787bffbdf89a0c77b7b3f4a04/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F88e11074e80d19e6f381f58894eac6dc3687a09a.png&amp;width=624" style="object-position:70.67307692307693% 66.4%;" data-reactid="69"/></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="70"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="71"><h1 data-reactid="72"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="73"><a href="http://www.racetothestones.com/" class="font-title " data-reactid="74">Race to the Stones &#x27;16</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 75 --><div class="Attribution op-70 font-title " data-reactid="76"><h5 data-reactid="77"><span class="Author f-s-xxs  color-box-pop" data-reactid="78"><a href="http://www.racetothestones.com">Race to the Stones</a></span></h5></div><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="79"><p data-reactid="80">In a momentary lapse of concentration/judgment I seem to have entered this race!!!

Waking up and looking out the window to see it had snowed over-night is not what you want to see when you know you have 16miles to run. I also felt like I had a monster hang-over which is strange as I haven't had anything to drink since Jan 3rd. My guess is that it was either dehydration or too much sugar the day/night before (Kiki had made sugar mice - very nice but pure sugar) anyway lesson learned, drink water and steer clear of the processed sugar on Saturdays! I did feel rubbish and procrastinating about when to do the run, Ollies rugby was then cancelled so decided that I just had to man-up and get out the door. I had programmed the run in the watch on Saturday so the idea was to stick with it for as long as possible. The plan was 1mile warm-up, 3 miles easy (HRZ 2), 10 mile marathon pace (6:48-6:55) and then 2mile easy (HRZ 2). This was the first time that at the end of my warm-up mile I stopped and did some dynamic stretches, I think it probably helped and will certainly do it again in future. What the stretches did do is bring the HR spike that I always get at the beginning of a run under Â control. Â As anticipated the 10m @ marathon pace was tough! to begin with it felt fast, almost the point where I though there was an issue with the Garmin and I struggled to get up to speed. Once there I felt relatively comfortable up to about mile 7 where it really started to hurt and keeping the pace at sub 7mins was hard work. I then finished it off with the 2 miles easy which I always wonder if this should be classified as part of the 16 miles, it seem a bit of a cheat to me. My next next LR with MP segments I may split the MP up into smaller sections and introduce the easy miles between the sections.","_html":"<p><b>Sunday </b>the dreaded long run day! Waking up and looking out the window to see it had snowed over-night is not what you want to see when you know you have 16miles to run. I also felt like I had a monster hang-over which is strange as I haven't had anything to drink since Jan 3rd. My guess is that it was either dehydration or too much sugar the day/night before (Kiki had made sugar mice - very nice but pure sugar) anyway lesson learned, drink water and steer clear of the processed sugar on Saturdays! I did feel rubbish and procrastinating about when to do the run, Ollies rugby was then cancelled so decided that I just had to man-up and get out the door. I had programmed the run in the watch on Saturday so the idea was to stick with it for as long as possible. The plan was 1mile warm-up, 3 miles easy (HRZ 2), 10 mile marathon pace (6:48-6:55) and then 2mile easy (HRZ 2). This was the first time that at the end of my warm-up mile I stopped and did some dynamic stretches, I think it probably helped and will certainly do it again in future. What the stretches did do is bring the HR spike that I always get at the beginning of a run under Â control. Â As anticipated the 10m @ marathon pace was tough! to begin with it felt fast, almost the point where I though there was an issue with the Garmin and I struggled to get up to speed. Once there I felt relatively comfortable up to about mile 7 where it really started to hurt and keeping the pace at sub 7mins was hard work. I then finished it off with the 2 miles easy which I always wonder if this should be classified as part of the 16 miles, it seem a bit of a cheat to me.
