running andÂ in particularÂ training, Â over the last five years is that you can only succeed if you have a goal. If you don&#x27;t have a goal there is no incentive to train &#x27;hard&#x27;. I use the term &#x27;hard&#x27; because IÂ actuallyÂ enjoy running and would more than happily just go for a jog in the countryside, but that is not training. What I mean is having the discipline to go out when the weather is lashing it down, pushing yourself for that last 2miles of a threshold run when it would be so easy to pack it in early, after all who is ever going to know?</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="56"><p data-reactid="57">The other thing that I have learnt is that you put something &#x27;out there&#x27; in the public domain you become accountable for it, people know what your goal is, they want to know how things are going and can give you a virtual push out the door when the mojo is not bouncing. But more importantly they want to know how you do when you make an attempt at your goal; through experience I know that facing those questions having not given it 100% is an experience far worse than any marathon.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="58"><p data-reactid="59">So here I am putting it out there:Â </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="60"><p data-reactid="61"></p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="62"><p data-reactid="63">Part of any training schedule should include a diary; the diary should include your training programme, what sessions you are going to do when but also it should include a reflective side so that in future training cycles you can look back and see what worked and what didn&#x27;t. I have to admit at this stage that whilst I record all my data I have never written a descriptive &#x27;blog&#x27; so this is a bit of an experiment; but if you you don&#x27;t do anything different you can&#x27;t expect different results. A purely data record of my training can be seen here</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="64"><p data-reactid="65">This was the first week back from holidays and the first week training proper. I had done quite a few hill runs of around 10km in 28 degree heat which was all good for strength, but not really appropriate for endurance or speed. I did however, re-read &#x27;Advanced Marathoning&#x27; by Pfitzinger &amp; Douglas who training schedule I had used on my previous attempt at sub 3hrs (although was not as honest with the programme or myself as I should have been). I am once again using their 18 week, up to 55 miles a week training plan.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="66"><p data-reactid="67">Officially this is known as a recovery week but still involves 37miles of running. Â Monday - Brr it was cold! minus 2 when I got back from doing a 3.5mile slow jog with Hadlow runners I also had Rusty with me. The rest of the week went to plan, with a total of 34miles.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="68"><p data-reactid="69">This was the first week of of the next mesocycle; a 5 week block that focus&#x27;s on &#x27;Lactate Threshold and Endurance&#x27; basically a lot of long runs and a lot of pain! This is the block where we train for mental toughness. The weekend previous I did something to my shoulder which means that it really hurts when running. Never the less the miles still need covering; 54 of them in-fact. I was out on Tuesday evening so had to do a 10 mile threshold run from the office at lunch time. The weather was appalling with wind and rain and the run hurt like hell, I wasn&#x27;t able to keep pace under marathon pace due to the conditions but pushed myself hard. Thursdays medium long run was relatively easy and I had Friday off from swimming in a hope that my shoulder would appreciated the recovery time. Sunday&#x27;s Long run was an 18 miler which I did as an interval run. with 5 sets of 1 mile MP &amp; 2 miles 20% slower than MP. It was the first run that I have done this session with a hydration pack, rather that just water I put together a drink of squash with 80g of castor sugar (1 letre). I am not sure if it was the fluids or the slower paced sections, but I felt strong at the end which was a 1st!Â </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="70"><p data-reactid="71">So the reason for limited updates has been mostly down to pure frustration. Week ten I had the injury to my shoulder started to get better with continued stretches and Â moving my watch to my right arm. I got my mid week runs done with no major issues except my shoulder, however on the Friday Threshold run I started to feel the beginnings of a cold, my wife had one the week previous so I was kind of expecting it, anyway managed to run on the Saturday but Sunday was really snotty and bunged up. I could have probably run but run the risk of the cold getting worse. As it was in week 9 the cold subsided quite quickly I managed to get out for a short run on the Monday and then a comfortable run on Tuesday with no pain in my shoulder and the cold almost gone. Unfortunately straight after my Tuesday run I went and picked up my daughter from gymnastics. Part of the pick-up involves putting all the equipment away. My back felt a bit sore after that but when I woke the next morning I was in a lot of pain! Needless to say I missed the rest of the runs this week. I did however mange a 2mile swim on the Friday and Sunday with a 3mile &#x27;testing the water&#x27; jog on the Sunday.Â </p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="2" class="Section
