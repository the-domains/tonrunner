data-reactid="53"><p>Sunday 28th February; this is the sixth consecutive year that I have run the Brighton Half, indeed this race was my first ever one over 10km. The weather that day was wet cold, blowing a gale and utterly miserable; it was so bad that at one stage I was going to quit it was only the fact that I was at the furthest part of the course and that I would have had to cover the ground anyway that I carried on. That was 6 years ago and thankfully we haven't had repeat of those weather conditions since. This Sunday was no exception, chilly yes but otherwise almost perfect running conditions. I say chilly as I parked the car the temperature gauge read 3 degrees; tights were a definite but I was still yet to make a decision on the long sleeve top.</p><p>The bag-drop and start/finish area was all different this year, so having walked half way down Madeira Drive to where the toilets tend to be slightly less busy I then realized I had to walk all the way back to where I had come from in order to drop my bag off. They area around the bag drop off was incredibly busy (something that I hope they re-think for next year) but it was sheltered and so felt quite warm, I therefore took the decision to lose the long sleeve, which I am very glad that I did. Whilst I wasn't rushed I did have to move a bit quicker than normal in order to change, drop the bag off and then get past the other 13,000 runners to the red pen at the head of the race. I got there with about 3-4 minutes to spare, so basically perfect timing! </p><p>Going into the race I didn't know what to expect of myself, training was going well enough until a couple of weeks prior to the race when I hurt my back, I hadn't been able to put the miles in and had only been able to do two run the week previous, both of which ended up being hard threshold runs of 7 and 10 miles neither of which I was able to maintain a great pace. I honestly didn't know what to expect; when asked, I said I would be disappointed with anything over 1:30 but happy with anything sub 1:28. I suppose subconsciously I thought that 1:27 was a realistic goal - well that was the pace I set on my Garmin.</p><p>There was a countdown and off we went; apparently we were started by Sally Gunnel, but to be honest I didn't realise and wasn't really bothered. As ever, everyone seemed to sprint away at the start, something I can never understand. Is 13.1 miles not far enough for you to overtake me without having to barge past in the first 200m?? Needless to say I tried to run at a perceived 'easy' pace and not get dragged along by the crowd, this was easy said than done. Mile 1 was a 6:16 which I felt comfortable with but thought was probably a bit quicker that I should have been going. Mile 2 I dropped a 6.03 - I am not sure where that came from but was clearly faster that I should have been going, I think it was due to one of the slight inclines on the run where I dug  in and pushed a bit harder than I should have done.  HR at this point was 168 so pushing threshold, not somewhere that I wanted to be for the next 11 miles!!</p><p>Miles 2-4 were not only the uppish 'hilly' part of the course but there was also a slight North Easterly wind, which, whilst not strong enough to make a huge impact was noticeable. At mile four we switched back and on to a mainly down hill section with the wind on our backs. In the past this section has caught me out, over stretching only to get found out in the last 3 miles. I was therefore happy to run consistent 6:16-6:19's for miles 4-10. </p><p>I really struggle psychologically at Brighton, I find it incredibly boring with long straight roads and being able to see 3-4 miles into the distance. With boredom my mind wanders and negative thoughts can creep in. The last 3 miles I found tough; as we had turned to make our way back East along the sea front towards Madeira Drive we had the wind (which had seemingly picked up) in our face again and I could see the peer 3 miles in the distance 'the finish line'. I had a mind battle where my body was just saying ease up but my mind was saying that all I had to do was keep steady and I was on for a great time - an opportunity that I might not ever get again, I kept on plugging away even though the wind just seemed to get stronger.</p><p>The last mile drops back away from the promenade and back onto the road allowing the buildings to afford a bit more shelter from the wind, It does however, mean that we are running on the opposite side of the road to all those at mile 7 on their way out. I don't remember exactly but I think one of the lanes was closed so it meant that with the volume of runners going the opposite direction that some of them spilled on to the wrong side of the cones, not something you want to see coming towards you as you are on the edge and fast losing co-ordination and avoidance skills. Fortunately, I didn't  have to make any evasive maneuvers but it could have been messy. </p><p>The finish straight is long perhaps 800m? but you really have no choice but to sprint it. Spectators are lined up either side cheering and it really is a 'grandstand' finish. You can see the clock a long way before you can read it, although I am sure I used to be able to read it easier in previous years, my eye sight must be worse than I thought! I could see it tick over to 1:21:45 and thought I might just be able to dip in under 1:22:00, heavy legs take a time to get up to max speed, I kept pushing even though I saw the clock hit 1:22:00 with a vain hope that my chip time would pull me back under, unfortunately with a finishing time of 1:22:09 my chip time only pulled me down to 1:22:03. - It's a shame but even so I am really happy with that time a one and a half minute PB.</p><p>My Garmin record can be found <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/1066512622">here</a></p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="54"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="56"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="57"><span data-reactid="58"><!-- react-empty: 59 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="60"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="61">Brighton Half Marathon 2016</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="62"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="63"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="64"><div class="Link" data-reactid="65"><a data-reactid="66"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>
