id="2" class="Component color-text p-1" data-reactid="62"><div class="component" data-reactid="63"><p>In the Bastion you have 2 hrs and 20 minutes to complete the swim leg followed by a further 10 minutes in the first transition to the bike. An average age group swimmer will generally complete the swim in 60-70 minutes.</p><p><em>This session including warm up and cool down covers around 2400-2800m – as the week’s progress keep adding a 400m repetition to the main set as your endurance builds and see if you can build this to 8 x 400m over time.</em></p><p>If you can it is highly beneficial to find somewhere that can do a one to one video analysis of your swimming, they will be able to talk you through the current errors in your technique and offer you drills and advice to work on and progress over time with the goal of ultimately making you more efficient and therefore faster in the water.</p><p>Joining a group swim session will also give you an opportunity to get feedback from a coach on your technique, although as it is a group session they will have a limited amount of time they can focus solely on you but it is a good starting point to begin working on technique corrections.</p><h2>Training for endurance swims</h2><p>While the swim on any iron distance event is the shortest part of the race at 3.8km, the swim leg can often the biggest hurdle for a lot of competitors in any triathlon.</p><p>As long as you can maintain an average 100m swim pace of around 3 mins 40 seconds for the full 3.8km distance you will make the swim cut off. However, a swimmer swimming at this pace for this duration will be very inefficient in the water, the more efficient you can be on the swim leg the more energy you will conserve for the following bike and run, and given the challenging nature of the course for The Bastion you are going to need it!</p><p>First it is important to feel comfortable covering the 3.8km distance you will need to during the race, if you aren’t swimming regularly already then you will need to build up your swim endurance. Do this gradually, we recommend you swim three times a week for 60-75 minutes in a pool based swim session, or two sessions minimum. When open water swimming venues are open in summer ideally add in a fourth open water session or make one of your three swim sessions an open water session.</p><p>An example endurance focused swim session</p><ul><li>Warm-up: 10 mins - easy swimming focusing on good technique and keep it relaxed, mix up the lengths with bilateral breathing on every 3rd or 5th stroke. Finish the warmup with a couple of lengths of kicking.</li></ul><ul><li>Main set: 4 x 400m 20 seconds rest between each 400m. Odd reps = bilateral breathing. Note your time for each 400m keep it steady keep it consistent.</li></ul><ul><li>Cool down: 5-10mins Easy swimming incorporate different strokes breast stroke/back stroke</li></ul><h2>Swim Technique</h2><p>Once your endurance has picked up a little it will allow you to focus more time on technique, technique in swimming is hugely important even the best swimmers are constantly working on perfecting their technique. However, technique correction for swimmers is a very individual thing, what works for one swimmer may not work for the next.</p><p>Technique takes a long time to perfect so depending on where you are at when you start your training and how far out from race day may mean you may not see as much progression as you want, a lot of practise and patience is required. However, if you are starting from a point where you have not had any instruction on swim technique before there might be some quick wins that will help you.</p><h2>Open Water Swimming</h2><p>It is very important to get plenty of open water swimming practice before your race, The Bastion swim course is very unique, a two lap course, you swim down a lake and navigate a sequence of buoys, then into a narrow river, as far as triathlon swim courses go it is actually quiet technical which is what makes it special. You will want to make sure you have practised your open water swimming sighting, don’t just rely on the person in front, what if they go wrong?!</p><p>Some key things to practise</p><p>Being in a wetsuit – sounds simple but wetsuits add extra resistance and pressure around your shoulders and chest which can feel very restrictive make sure you are comfortable with this feeling</p><p>Group starts – the feeling of swimming with lots of other people around you, this combined with the restrictive feeling of a wetsuit can cause many people to panic, make sure you feel comfortable in this environment</p><p>The distance – Can you comfortably cover the ironman distance in open water?</p><p>Sighting – Simply, the straighter you swim between buoys the less distance you will cover on race day, going off course is wasted time and energy. Also, the more you efficient your sighting technique and the smaller the movement is will mean it has less impact on slowing you down in the water.</p><h2>Join a Group Swim Session</h2><p>If you can find a local triathlon club or swimming club to join in sessions do so for at least one of your swims, while they may not be training for a similar event all time in the water is good! Swimming with others will help you keep it interesting, motivate you and push you harder.</p><h2>Structure Your Sessions</h2><p>If you can’t find a group swim session that works for you there are still plenty of ways you can help your swimming progress when swimming by yourself.</p><p>Don’t just go to the pool and swim mindless lengths! It’s very common for people who simply go and swim for 1500m or 60 lengths by themselves with no structure find they never improve their speed and soon become bored of it. Structuring your swim sets to different repetitions, distances and paces will help improve your speed and keep things interesting. It’s a good idea to wear a simple watch so you can time your repetitions for consistency. There are plenty of free resources online these days that will give you different session ideas if you need a little inspiration.</p><h2>Monitor Your Progression - Swim Tests!</h2><p>Incorporating a regular time trial test every 6-8 weeks will help you to assess how you are progressing. A common test format is after a warm-up time your best 400m effort, take a recovery and swim a few lengths easy then repeat you best 200m effort, you will be able to assess how well you are able to maintain your 100m pace. Record your times and see if you progress over the duration of your training.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="64"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="65"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="66"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="67"><span data-reactid="68"><!-- react-empty: 69 --><h2 data-reactid="70"><a data-reactid="71">Building Endurance</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="72"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="73"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="74"><div class="Link" data-reactid="75"><a data-reactid="76">Anthony Lester</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="77"></div></section></div></div>
