description: 'A great evening race at Leybourne Lakes. My first ever aquathlon! The race had two distances running simultaneously a 750m swim and a 1500m swim each followed by a 5k run. The two running together was slightly confusing and led to me going off far to fast on the swim. Got to about 25om metre and nearly died, slowed down a bit recovered and the second lap of the swim was much more comfortable with less people.'

A great evening race at Leybourne Lakes. My first ever aquathlon! The race had two distances running simultaneously a 750m swim and a 1500m swim each followed by a 5k run. The two running together was slightly confusing and led to me going off far to fast on the swim. Got to about 25om metre and nearly died, slowed down a bit recovered and the second lap of the swim was much more comfortable with less people.
