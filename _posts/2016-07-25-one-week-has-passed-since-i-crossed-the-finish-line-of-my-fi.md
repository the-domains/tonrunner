  One week has passed since I crossed the finish line of my first 100km race
  with these two hero's.

  Here we are, looking slightly rough, but happy, stunned and all still smiling
  at the end of our adventures. Armed with a speaker, some music and boundless
  enthusiasm and energy, we brought the PARTAY to the final 50km of Race To The
  Stones. For me these races are ALWAYS about people, meeting with and
  connecting with different people over that one common ground, and I'm so lucky
  I got to meet these guys and spend what I thought would be a lonely 50k making
  some connections and memories to last a lifetime.
