# Brighton Half Marathon 2016

Sunday 28th February, 

This is the sixth consecutive year that I have run the Brighton Half, indeed this race was my first ever race over 10km. That first race was wet cold, blowing a gale and utterly miserable; it was so bad that at one stage I was going to quit it was only the fact that I was at the furthest part of the course and that I would have had to cover the ground anyway that I carried on. That was 6 years ago and thankfully we haven't had repeat of those weather conditions since. This Sunday was no exception, chilly yes but otherwise almost perfect running conditions. I say chilly as I parked the car the temperature gauge read 3 degrees; tights were a definite but I was still yet to make a decision on the long sleeve top.

The bag-drop and start/finish area was all different this year, so having walked half way down Madeira Drive to where the toilets tend to be slightly less busy I then realized I had to walk all the way back to where I had come from in order to drop my bag off. They area around the bag drop off was incredibly busy (something that I hope they re-think for next year) but it was sheltered and so felt quite warm, I therefore took the decision to lose the long sleeve, which I am very glad that I did. Whilst I wasn't rushed I did have to move a bit quicker than normal in order to change, drop the bag off and then get past the other 13,000 runners to the red pen at the head of the race. I got there with about 3-4 minutes to spare so basically perfect timing. 

Going into the race I didn't know what to expect of myself, training was going well enough until a couple of weeks prior to the race when I hurt my back, I hadn't been able to put the miles in and had only been able to do two run the week previous, both of which ended up being hard threshold runs of 7 and 10 miles neither of which I was able to maintain a great pace. I honestly didn't know what to expect, when asked I said I would be disappointed with anything over 1:30 but happy with anything sub 1:28\. I suppose subconsciously I though that 1:27 was a realistic goal - well that's the pace I set for my Garmin.

The countdown went and off we went, apparently we were started by Sally Gunnel but tbh I didn't know or was bothered.
