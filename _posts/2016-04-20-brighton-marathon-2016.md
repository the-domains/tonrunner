# Brighton Marathon 2016

I made another one of my annual pilgrimages to Brighton today to take part in the 2016 Brighton Marathon.

Had a good day at the office, having had a good first 8 weeks to the training my original intention was to go for a 3:05 her and gain good for age for London next year; you may remember my half marathon time suggested I was on the right track, unfortunately since then I have had a back injury that has plagued training and meant that in the last 6 weeks I have done no speed work and my longest run has been just under 12 miles, prior to that I had done one 20 mile run. Needless to say I was not going into the run with too many expectations.

I set my watch to equate to a 3hr15min pace purely because it was an easy number to add or take away my split times from. Set off at that pace that seemed extremely slow but was very disciplined and held my self back as the waves came past. It carried on feeling OK and at mile 19 started to feel comfortable and perhaps got a bit over confident and increasing the pace. At around 22 miles the course head past the power station which today absolutely stank almost to gagging point, that's when it felt a bit tougher so I eased back a bit still trying to stay within the 7:30miles for a 3:15 time.

I dropped below that pace for one mile the 25th because I had to stop to be sick (being sick on the move wasn't working for me today :) ) even so I picked myself up and went again and that mile I was only 3 seconds above my target pace.

I ended up with a chip time of 3:12:09 not a PB (by 3 mins) but still very happy to know that my base fitness is not as bad as I thought it could have been. With a lot of work and a bit of luck I may still be able to get a 3.05 at Kent Roadrunners at the end of May.
