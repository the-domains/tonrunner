  Mobility Monday! Today we look at the almighty Squat! The squat is one of the
  most (if not the most) important shapes we should be comfortable in.

  Strength training aside, the squat is one of the best ways to see if our
  joints can perform normally. Specifically, we should be able to express all of
  the following: * Full hip flexion (closing of the hip). You can see this if
  you are able to get your pockets below your knees. A limit in hip flexion can
  also manifest with knees caving inwards during the squat (motor control and
  strength aside). * Maintenance of a neutral spine. Can you maintain the
  natural lumbar curve in your back when deep in your squat? If not there's a
  good chance your hips are tight! * Heel stays grounded. If the only way you
  can achieve full depth is by letting your heels leave the ground, we could be
  looking at some real stiff ankles. Faults in the above points will typically
  manifest near end-range in the joint, which in the squat, shows up as we get
  deeper and deeper. So, how deep can you squat with all those points of
  performance? Challenge: Can you hold a squat for 2 minutes? 5 minutes? Give it
  a go once a day and see if you can improve this over a one week span! Happy
  Monday! #MobilityMonday #TheRunExperience #PositionIsPower #Mobility
