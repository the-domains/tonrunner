This was a post that I wrote on Tonbridge parkrun's Facebook account, for my future reference (when an email complaining about us not scanning and barcode on a phone) 

'Today was my 100th parkrun; my 80th run at Tonbridge. I have have been a first finisher I have been a final finisher, I have run several PB's although seen my average time increase by 4 minutes.

I have run 4 different courses. I have run through 'lakes', slid through quagmire, slipped on ice, through forests and across bouncing bridges. I have had the pleasure of pacing others to their

PB's. I have been a proud father watching my little boy grow to love his running and have been lucky to have an opportunity to run with some inspirational juniors.

I have started at the front and been overtaken and I have started from the back and moved my way through the crowd. I have said to 'good morning' to many dog walkers and fisherman, thank-you to as many marshals as I have had breath for, and learnt the names of countless runners who I now count as friends. I have had chats and shared gossip before whilst and after running, and worn more fancy dress costumes than I care to remembers

I have scanned thousands of barcodes and had the honour of being the first to congratulate so many people who thought they could never complete 5km let alone run it. I have witnessed the the joy on the faces of so many ordinary people achieving their personal goals and getting the best out of themselves.

I have seen our numbers swell from the low 100's in the early days to now over 300 people. I have seen over 4500 people from Tonbridge register to run with us (that is over 11% of the population), I have seen with that growth the same welcome and encouragement given to every new runner and every tourist. New friends have been made and old ones re-acquainted.

All these things and so many more I have taken from my parkrun experience so far. In just 100 runs - 310miles - my life is that much richer, how is that possible? I feel like I owe you.

Thank-you Tonbridge parkrun, I will wear my milestone T-shirt with pride and thanks for everything you have given me, I hope that my efforts go some way to repaying you, honestly it is an absolute pleasure.
