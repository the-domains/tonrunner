description: 'Buddhists have a way to tame those animals: meditation. This ancient practice is traditionally done while sitting and focusing on your breathing to achieve peace of mind. But more and more runners are learning how to clear out the commotion while on roads and trails, thanks in part to Sakyong Jamgon Mipham Rinpoche, spiritual leader of a global network of Shambhala Centers (meditation meeting places).'
