# Hever Castle Triathlon '15
![Me and my brother before the race, I am the slightly less hairy one!](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/39c0416d-0836-4b02-8f98-08a88dda0220.jpg)

Standard Distance:1900m swim, 40km Ride, 10km Bike

A beautiful but challenging course for my first standard distance triathlon. Posted a 2hr32min time which put me in 64th position out of about 800 so happy with that.
![Mayhem at the beginning of the swim; arms & legs everywhere fortunately I got out front and stayed out of trouble](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3a152f63-fbfd-46f6-a189-85b8a0972b0e.jpg)
![I came out the water in 34th in 24 mins so very happy with that. Just got to work on bike and run now!](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e51da7a5-4275-4bc0-919b-d4c39a9c6f63.jpg)
