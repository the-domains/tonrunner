Runners as a rule rarely warm-up beyond lacing up and starting off slow. Yes the occasional toe touch goes in the right direction...but falls woefully short of "undoing" all the time spent in stiff positions at work, in the car, or at home.! 

So try this 2 minute dynamic series next time you run and notice the IMMEDIATE difference in how you feel and perform! 

After ~5 minutes of easy form focused running, stop (literally ANYWHERE) works and perform: 

* 10 squats 
* 10 leg swings 
* 10 lunges 
* 10 burpees

Then continue with the rest of your run workout! This 2 minutes acts as an all important "_check in_" on your mobility, core strength, and overall movement. Just by doing a little bit each and every time you go out the door, you clean up your run mechanics, you tune into your posture, and you are one step closer to preventing that next over use injury.
