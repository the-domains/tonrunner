description: "First, a confession: my interest in swimming began after I read about Michael Phelps' diet. The decorated Olympic swimmer, I found out, consumes a whopping 12,000 calories a day, involving the chomping down of pizzas, pasta and eight-egg omelettes. If Phelpsy can eat all that and look completely ripped, maybe it's time the rest of us headed to the pool, hey?"
