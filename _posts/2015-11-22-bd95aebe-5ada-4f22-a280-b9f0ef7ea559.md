![#parkrun # 50 & #volunteer T-shirts. #loveparkrun](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/99cb4bfd-3ae6-4bd8-b50b-09f0ae1c3ce0.jpg)

parkrun celebrates peoples milestones by giving them free technical T-shirts from Tribe Sport. Juniors receive a T for 10 completed runs while adults must run 50/100/250/500\. You can also get a very special volunteer T-shirt if you volunteer 25 times or more.
