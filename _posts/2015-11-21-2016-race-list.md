I like competing, I never used to but I have found more and more that I do. It maybe that I have come to accept that I am not really competing against anyone else merely against myself; can I go further faster or higher than I have done before. I think it also comes with the realisation that there is always going to be somebody better than you. 

Anyway in order to compete you have to enter races. I don't enter many because of the cost - some races cost up to £90 and time, Mrs L. would not be too pleased if I spent every weekend away from home spending vast sums of money and being wrecked for the following week. I am therefore quite selective about the races that I do. First and main criteria is can I travel to it by car on the morning of the race without getting up any earlier that 5.30am. If not do I have anywhere to stay before for free. If I can't get a 'yes' from either of these questions it doesn't get a look in. Fortunately we are blessed with some great races for running,  cycling and swimming and of course Triathlon.

One of the issues that I have is remembering which events I have entered and which dates they are on, as I normally try to get the early bird entries that tend to be significantly cheaper than normal. This can mean entering a race up to 12 months in advance! I have therefore decided to write my entries down and as I complete them put my times positions etc down.  In simple terms I'm creating my race diary.
