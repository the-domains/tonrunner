# Anthony Lester

This is my scrapbook of all things that interest, amuse, fascinate and inspire me in the world of swimming, cycling and running. I could have done it on facebook but all my friends and family are probably sick to death of my constant witterings and ramblings. 

I am fortunate enough to be the event director of Tonbridge parkrun so there will be plenty of posts from there.
