This is my scrapbook of all things that interest, amuse, fascinate and inspire me in the world of swimming, cycling and running. I could have done it on facebook but all my friends and family are probably sick to death of my constant witterings and ramblings. 

I am fortunate enough to be the event director of Tonbridge parkrun so there will be plenty of posts from there.

My running background is surprisingly short having only really started running properly in 2009\. I have always been keen sportsman but after leaving university there never seemed to be the time, a concept that I have since realised was a total untruth. Since 2009, however, running has become a part of my life, I got started with a hard10K having done no training but still finishing in a respectable time. With this experience I caught the running bug and have since complete multiple marathons and countless half marathons. 

I love to run, yes, I love to push myself to the limit of my capabilities and fulfil my potential, I love to challenge myself I love the chance being able to aim for my personal goals, to often fail but having the opportunity to aim for them again the next time I run. But I am also passionate about running.

I am passionate about getting others to experience the sense of achievement of running further than you have ever done before, the sense of freedom being able to walk out of your front door and being able to go where ever you want or the exhilaration of crossing a finish line. Running is so much more than just going from A-B or for a jog around the block, yes it can be a mode of transport, a physical workout but it can also be your__time, a time to clear your head of life's problems allowing you clarity and a fresh perspective. I could go on for page after page with an excitable rant but doesn't that define passion, an intense emotion towards a specific subject?
