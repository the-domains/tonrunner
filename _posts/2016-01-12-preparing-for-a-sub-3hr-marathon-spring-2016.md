One of the many things I have learned about running and in particular training,  over the last five years is that you can only succeed if you have a goal. If you don't have a goal there is no incentive to train 'hard'. I use the term 'hard' because I actually enjoy running and would more than happily just go for a jog in the countryside, but that is not training. What I mean is having the discipline to go out when the weather is lashing it down, pushing yourself for that last 2miles of a threshold run when it would be so easy to pack it in early, after all who is ever going to know?

The other thing that I have learnt is that you put something 'out there' in the public domain you become accountable for it, people know what your goal is, they want to know how things are going and can give you a virtual push out the door when the mojo is not bouncing. But more importantly they want to know how you do when you make an attempt at your goal; through experience I know that facing those questions having not given it 100% is an experience far worse than any marathon.

So here I am putting it out there:

> This spring/summer I am going to attempt to run a sub 3hr marathon.

Part of any training schedule should include a diary; the diary should include your training programme, what sessions you are going to do when but also it should include a reflective side so that in future training cycles you can look back and see what worked and what didn't. I have to admit at this stage that whilst I record all my data I have never written a descriptive 'blog' so this is a bit of an experiment; but if you you don't do anything different you can't expect different results. A purely data record of my training can be seen [here][0]

## 14 Weeks to Brighton

This was the first week back from holidays and the first week training proper. I had done quite a few hill runs of around 10km in 28 degree heat which was all good for strength, but not really appropriate for endurance or speed. I did however, re-read _'Advanced Marathoning' by Pfitzinger & Douglas _who training schedule I had used on my previous attempt at sub 3hrs (although was not as honest with the programme or myself as I should have been). I am once again using their 18 week, up to 55 miles a week training plan.

I was a bit foolish as I started the week by blasting out a 4miler with he adidas 26rs when I should have been doing a recovery run (even though I hadn't actually done the long run the weekend before) of course I paid for it and felt it in my legs for the rest of the week. Lesson learnt - when the program say rest / recovery / core session there is a reason. 

There were a couple of aerobic sessions of 8 and 10 miles and of course a longer run of 15 miles on the Sunday, all were completed within the parameters set down in the programme with not too much fuss except the afore mentioned latent fatigue from my Monday fool hardiness. Friday was a core/rest day so as I have been doing over the last few months whilst it is cold I went swimming doing a 3.2km in 60mins.

## 13 Weeks to Brighton

Lesson learnt from last week, **Monday** was a short recovery 3.3mile run with Hadlow Runners around Tonbridge. **Tuesday** was the first real 'tester' of the program and one that going to let me know where I stood. It was a threshold run, 9 mile with 5miles at half marathon pace (around 6:28/mile). It was OK but started to hurt for the last couple of miles but I kept up the pace dropping just below 6.33/m for the last 2miles; it probably didn't help that there was a slight incline, headwind and I was overdressed!! I think it was a good session for 'mental toughness' training as the course went past home with 3miles to go.   **Wednesday **was a rest day so a nice easy 4.5 miles with Hadlow runners around Tonbridge. 

**Thursday** was 10 miles of G_eneral Aerobic_ (GA); first of all it was bloody cold! well it probably wasn't that cold, about 1 degree but this winter really hasn't kicked in until now, with balmy temperatures of around 10 or 11 so dropping that much in one day was a shock to the system. Anyway despite this I still got out and did it, although there were a couple of issues along the way. My 1mile warm-up as set by my Garmin transpired to be a 1metre warm-up clearly I had messed up the program when I set it up on the computer! Secondly GA means that you should be running in Heart Rate Zone (HRZ) \#3 in my case 149-161 which is fine but the upper limit of that means that I am running very close to lactate threshold - 10 miles of that is tough going especially as Tuesdays session was exactly that!  

**Friday** was a rest/core day or as it has become commonly known a swim day. Disappointingly my watch was playing silly buggers so missed 17 lengths (425m) and only recorded 2750m in 58mins which doesn't look great on Strava but at least I know that it was a better session than that. 

**Saturday** or parkrunday was a 5mile recovery day, unfortunately being event director I don't get an opportunity to tag on a run at the beginning or end so settled with the 3 miles of parkrun and then another 3miles with Rusty when I got home - it's not fair to take him out just for 2 miles! parkrun was one of the most enjoyable I have done for a long time. As  I was meant to be running 'recovery pace' I knew that I had to run with somebody else otherwise the '_red mist_' would have come down and  I would end up ruining my Sunday run. There are two young girls Sophie(8) and Lily(9) who have been running pr for some time now with their Dad. At the end of each run their Dad looks spent whilst the girls look like they could have gone at least a minute quicker. I had said the previous week that I would be happy to take around Sophie (the quicker of the two) if she wanted me to. Anyway I ran with her this week and she was an absolute star! We had a couple of chats around the course but really I let her run as she wanted to and good on her she pushed herself . The conditions were good, although we had to divert onto rough grass 3 times that probably didn't help with tired legs, she posted a 22.24 just over a minute outside her PB but very impressive none the less. 

**Sunday **the dreaded long run day! Waking up and looking out the window to see it had snowed over-night is not what you want to see when you know you have 16miles to run. I also felt like I had a monster hang-over which is strange as I haven't had anything to drink since Jan 3rd. My guess is that it was either dehydration or too much sugar the day/night before (Kiki had made sugar mice - very nice but pure sugar) anyway lesson learned, drink water and steer clear of the processed sugar on Saturdays! I did feel rubbish and procrastinating about when to do the run, Ollies rugby was then cancelled so decided that I just had to man-up and get out the door. I had programmed the run in the watch on Saturday so the idea was to stick with it for as long as possible. The plan was 1mile warm-up, 3 miles easy (HRZ 2), 10 mile marathon pace (6:48-6:55) and then 2mile easy (HRZ 2). This was the first time that at the end of my warm-up mile I stopped and did some dynamic stretches, I think it probably helped and will certainly do it again in future. What the stretches did do is bring the HR spike that I always get at the beginning of a run under  control.  As anticipated the 10m @ marathon pace was tough! to begin with it felt fast, almost the point where I though there was an issue with the Garmin and I struggled to get up to speed. Once there I felt relatively comfortable up to about mile 7 where it really started to hurt and keeping the pace at sub 7mins was hard work. I then finished it off with the 2 miles easy which I always wonder if this should be classified as part of the 16 miles, it seem a bit of a cheat to me. My next next LR with MP segments I may split the MP up into smaller sections and introduce the easy miles between the sections.

## 12 Weeks to Brighton

Officially this is known as a recovery week but still involves 37miles of running.
