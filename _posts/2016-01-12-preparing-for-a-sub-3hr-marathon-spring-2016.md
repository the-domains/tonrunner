# Preparing for a sub 3hr marathon, Spring 2016

One of the many things I have learned about running and in particular training,  over the last five years is that you can only succeed if you have a goal. If you don't have a goal there is no incentive to train 'hard'. I use the term 'hard' because I actually enjoy running and would more than happily just go for a jog in the countryside, but that is not training. What I mean is having the discipline to go out when the weather is lashing it down, pushing yourself for that last 2miles of a threshold run when it would be so easy to pack it in early, after all who is ever going to know?

The other thing that I have learnt is that you put something 'out there' in the public domain you become accountable for it, people know what your goal is, they want to know how things are going and can give you a virtual push out the door when the mojo is not bouncing. But more importantly they want to know how you do when you make an attempt at your goal; through experience I know that facing those questions having not given it 100% is an experience far worse than any marathon.

So here I am putting it out there:

> This spring/summer I am going to attempt to run a sub 3hr marathon.

Part of any training schedule should include a diary; the diary should include your training programme, what sessions you are going to do when but also it should include a reflective side so that in future training cycles you can look back and see what worked and what didn't. I have to admit at this stage that whilst I record all my data I have never written a descriptive 'blog' so this is a bit of an experiment; but if you you don't do anything different you can't expect different results.

# 14 Weeks to Brighton

This was the first week back from holidays and the first week training proper. I had done quite a few hill runs of around 10km in 28 degree heat which was all good for strength, but not really appropriate for endurance or speed. I did however, re-read _'Advanced Marathoning' by Pfitzinger & Douglas _who training schedule I had used on my previous attempt at sub 3hrs (although was not as honest with the programme or myself as I should have been). I am once again using their 18 week, up to 55 miles a week training plan.

I was a bit foolish as I started the week by blasting out a 4miler with he adidas 26rs when I should have been doing a recovery run (even though I hadn't actually done the long run the weekend before) of course I paid for it and felt it in my legs for the rest of the week. Lesson learnt - when the program say rest / recovery / core session there is a reason. 

There were a couple of aerobic sessions of 8 and 10 miles and of course a longer run of 15 miles on the Sunday, all were completed within the parameters set down in the programme with not too much fuss except the afore mentioned latent fatigue from my Monday fool hardiness. Friday was a core/rest day so as I have been doing over the last few months whilst it is cold I went swimming doing a 3.2km in 60mins.

# 13 Weeks to Brighton

Lesson learnt from last week, **Monday** was a short recovery 3.3mile run with Hadlow Runners around Tonbridge. **Tuesday** was the first real 'tester' of the program and one that going to let me know where I stood. It was a threshold run, 9 mile with 5miles at half marathon pace (around 6:28/mile). It was OK but started to hurt for the last couple of miles but I kept up the pace dropping just below 6.33/m for the last 2miles; it probably didn't help that there was a slight incline, headwind and I was overdressed!! I think it was a good session for 'mental toughness' training as the course went past home with 3miles to go.   **Wednesday **was a rest day so a nice easy 4.5 miles with Hadlow runners around Tonbridge. **Thursday** was 10 miles of G_eneral Aerobic_ (GA); first of all it was bloody cold! well it probably wasn't that cold, about 1 degree but this winter really hasn't kicked in until now, with balmy temperatures of around 10 or 11 so dropping that much in one day was a shock to the system. Anyway despite this I still got out and did it, although there were a couple of issues along the way. My 1mile warm-up as set by my Garmin transpired to be a 1metre warm-up clearly I had messed up the program when I set it up on the computer! Secondly GA means that you should be running in Heart Rate Zone (HRZ) \#3 in my case 149-161 which is fine but the upper limit of that means that I am running very close to lactate threshold - 10 miles of that is tough going especially as Tuesdays session was exactly that!
